# Git Introduction

Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed. 

Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
