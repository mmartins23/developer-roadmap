# Git Introduction

Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed. 

Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.

## Initializing a new repository

The `git init` command is used to initialize a new Git repository. When you run this command, Git sets up all the necessary files and directories for version control in the current working directory, creating a new repository.


To summarize, `git init` is a one-time command used to set up a new Git repository in a project directory. It prepares the environment for version control and establishes the initial configuration needed for tracking changes and managing project history.
